# Wrong Hole

This is a game project created for the class CIS580 - Game Programming on KSU.

Wrong Hole is a small and confusing game focused on leaving you impressed, confused (and frustrated - at that point it is a skill issue)...

Theres holes, balls and soothing sound and subtle colors (even slight shade differences are important). What more can I say, go and find out.
